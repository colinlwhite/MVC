# ASP.NET MVC
This is an introductory overview of MVC. 
This project covers how MVC looks, runs and its most important features. 
Eventually, I will compare MVC to ASP.NET Core's other four project types. 

# Short Description
MVC is a hybrid project that includes elements of API and it can display Razor Pages as well.
A `View` can include `React`, `Angular` or `Vue.js` which makes this project attractive as well.
All JavaScript front-ends have to have an API to support them so MVC can be that API.
